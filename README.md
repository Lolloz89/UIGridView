UIGridView (iOS = iPhone/iPad)
========================

UIGridView offers a simple way to build a grid (multiple-column UITableView).

Its structure resembles that of UITableView. The code is really small. You may take a look to learn it and extend it.

In the project, there is an example of building a custom cell.

How to use it
------------------------
1. Include /Classes/UIGridView/* into your project
